This is just a trial to learn more about computational modeling for cochlear.

So it is based on AMT "AUDITORY MODELING TOOLBOX"

More info about AMT can be found here : http://www.amtoolbox.org/

So I would like to share in brief my resources and efforts that helped me to understand and compile the model:

At the beginning , I found  that I do not know many of the abbreviations as well as the concept for modeling the cochlear.  So: 
1. I found UCL extend offering an introduction course for the audiology  “Audiology taster course ” (attached the completion certificate), so I enrolled. It was really a good decision as to know the main concepts of the auditory system and abbreviation.

2. At this time, I make use of being in Cairo to speak with an audiologist and discuss what I learned in the UCL extend course, so after long time of searching, I successfully visited Cairo University Medical school and It was very informative visit that consolidate many concepts. Kindly find the report for my visit. https://github.com/Zikovich/amt/blob/main/Islam-Cairo-Uni-Hosptial-Visit.pdf

3. But still I need the mapping between which is called physiological behaviour and computational modeling, I actually searched for many materials and these are the most informative resources
   1. Mohamed Zilany Thesis "Modeling the Neural Representation of Speech in Normal Hearing and Hearing Impaired Listeners", specially chapter 2 and 3. https://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/papers/zilany_thesis.pdf
   2. And Lyon's book: Human and Machine Hearing Extracting Meaning from Sound, https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/human-and-machine-hearing/3660166B40020EE587D94BB7A309FC12
   3. and actually many websites but this one is very special http://www.cochlea.eu/en/cochlea/function

4. In parallel to the previous points, I am trying to install and bring up the AMT toolbox and figure out the structure. Thanks a lot for their documentation and paper, this step takes too much time, more than 20 hrs. https://acta-acustica.edpsciences.org/articles/aacus/full_html/2022/01/aacus210052/aacus210052.html#S12

5. Also, I searched for other tools for modeling but due to shortage of time, I focused on AMT as well and I found the online matlab tool by Carney Lab is very useful. https://urhear.urmc.rochester.edu/webapps/home/session.html?app=UR_EAR_2022a

Actually, This kind of learning by discovery - around 50 hrs- proves to myself my passion to solve real hearing loss problems.
