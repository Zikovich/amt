function [ihc_out, state] = lyon2011_ihcstep(filters_out, coeffs, state)
%LYON2011_IHCSTEP update of inner-hair-cell (IHC) model
%
%   Usage: [CF, decim_naps, naps, BM, ohc, agc] = lyon2011(CF, input_waves, AGC_plot_fig_num, open_loop);
%
%   Input parameters:
%     detects             : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                           state; if you want to break the input up into
%                           segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                           to keep the state between segments.
%     coeffs              : input_waves is a column vector if there's just one
%                           audio channel; more generally, it has a row per 
%                           time sample, a column per audio channel. The 
%                           input_waves are assumed to be sampled at the 
%                           same rate as the CARFAC is designed for. 
%                           A resampling may be needed before calling this.
%     state               : Plot automatic gain control figure. Default is 0.
%
%   Output parameters:
%     state               : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                           state; if you want to break the input up into
%                           segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                           to keep the state between segments.
%     update              : decim_naps is like naps but time-decimated by 
%                           the int CF.decimation.
%
%   LYON2011_IHCSTEP updates the inner-hair-cell (IHC) model, including the
%   detection nonlinearity and one or two capacitor state variables.
