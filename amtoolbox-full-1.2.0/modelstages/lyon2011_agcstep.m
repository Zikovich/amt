%   Usage: [CF, decim_naps, naps, BM, ohc, agc] = lyon2011(CF, input_waves, AGC_plot_fig_num, open_loop);

%
%   Input parameters:
%     detects           : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                         state; if you want to break the input up into
%                         segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                         to keep the state between segments.
%     coeffs           : input_waves is a column vector if there's just one
%                        audio channel; more generally, it has a row per 
%                        time sample, a column per audio channel. The 
%                        input_waves are assumed to be sampled at the 
%                        same rate as the CARFAC is designed for. 
%                        A resampling may be needed before calling this.
%     state            : Plot automatic gain control figure. Default is 0.
%
%   Output parameters:
%     state            : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                        state; if you want to break the input up into
%                        segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                        to keep the state between segments.
%     update           : decim_naps is like naps but time-decimated by 
%                        the int CF.decimation.
