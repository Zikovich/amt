%   Input parameters:
%     detects             : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                           state; if you want to break the input up into
%                           segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                           to keep the state between segments.
%     coeffs              : input_waves is a column vector if there's just one
%                           audio channel; more generally, it has a row per 
%                           time sample, a column per audio channel. The 
%                           input_waves are assumed to be sampled at the 
%                           same rate as the CARFAC is designed for. 
%                           A resampling may be needed before calling this.
%     state               : Plot automatic gain control figure. Default is 0.
%
%   Output parameters:
%     state               : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                           state; if you want to break the input up into
%                           segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                           to keep the state between segments.
%     update              : decim_naps is like naps but time-decimated by 
%                           the int CF.decimation.
