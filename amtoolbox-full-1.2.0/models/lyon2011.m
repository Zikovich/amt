function [CF, decim_naps, naps, BM, ohc, agc] = lyon2011(input_waves, varargin)
%LYON2011 Cascade of asymmetric resonators with fast-acting compression (CARFAC) model
%   Usage: [CF, decim_naps, naps, BM, ohc, agc] = lyon2011(CF, input_waves, AGC_plot_fig_num, open_loop);
%
%
%   Input parameters:
%     CF               : optional struct, holds the filterbank design and state
%     input_waves      : input_waves is a column vector if there's just one
%                        audio channel; more generally, it has a row per 
%                        time sample, a column per audio channel. The 
%                        input_waves are assumed to be sampled at the 
%                        same rate as the CARFAC model is designed for. 
%                        A resampling may be needed before calling this.
%
%   Output parameters:
%     CF               : The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                        state; if you want to break the input up into
%                        segments, you need to use the updated CF
%                        to keep the state between segments.
%     decim_naps       : decim_naps is like naps but time-decimated by 
%                        the int CF.decimation.
%     naps             : naps (neural activity patterns) has a row per 
%                        time sample, a column per filterbank channel, 
%                        and a layer per audio channel if `CF, AGC_plot_fig_num, 
%                        open_loop > 1`.
%     BM               : BM is basilar membrane motion (filter outputs before detection).
%     ohc              : optional extra output for diagnosing internals.
%     agc              : optional extra outputs for diagnosing internals.
%
%   LYON2011 runs the CARFAC model. That is, it filters a 1 or more channel sound 
%   input to make one or more neural activity patterns (naps).
%
%   Additional input parameters:
%
%     'CF',CF                    The CF struct holds the filterbank design and 
%                                state; if you want to break the input up into 
%                                segments, you need to use the updated CF 
%                                to keep the state between segments.
%
%     'AGC_plot_fig_num',fn      Plot automatic gain control figure. Default is 0.
%
%   Flags:
%
%     'open_loop'                Use model with open loop. Default is 0.
