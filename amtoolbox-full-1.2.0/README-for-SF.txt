The "amtoolbox-x.x.x.zip" file contains the pure AMT with Matlab/Octave scripts and source codes (C++, C, Python) of the models.

The "amtoolbox-full-x.x.x.zip" file contains the AMT and all required toolboxes installed.

For the installation follow the documentation on amt_start from <http://amtoolbox.org>.

Most of the experiments require auxiliary data. The auxdata will be automatically downloaded on demand from <http://amtoolbox.org/amt-x.x.x/auxdata> with x.x.x being the AMT version. 

Some of the AMT functions require a large processing time. Depending on the machine and the model, it might take even days. Thus, some AMT functions provide caching of calculated results. Started in the default mode, the cached results will be automatically downloaded. For actual calculations, start the AMT with the flag 'redo'. 

Have much fun!
